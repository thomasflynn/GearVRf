/**
 * Finds the scene objects that are hit by a ray.
 *
 * The picker can function in two modes. One way is to simply call its
 * static functions to make a single scan through the scene to determine
 * what is hit by the picking ray.
 * <p/>
 * The other way is to add the picker as a component to a scene object.
 * The picking ray is generated from the camera viewpoint
 * each frame. It's origin is the camera position and it's direction is
 * the camera forward look vector (what the user is looking at).
 * <p/>
 * For a {@linkplain GVRSceneObject scene object} to be pickable, it must have a
 * {@link GVRCollider} component attached to it that is enabled. 
 * The picker "casts" a ray into the screen graph, and returns an array
 * containing all the collisions as instances of GVRPickedObject.
 * The picked object contains the collider instance hit, the distance from the
 * camera and the hit position.
 * <p/>
 * The picker maintains the list of currently picked objects
 * (which can be obtained with getPicked()) and continually updates it each frame.
 * <p/>
 * In this mode, when the ray from the scene object hits a pickable object,
 * the picker generates one or more pick events (IPickEvents interface)
 * which are sent the event receiver of the scene. These events can be
 * observed by listeners.
 * <ul>>
 * <li>onEnter(GVRSceneObject)  called when the pick ray enters a scene object.</li>
 * <li>onExit(GVRSceneObject)   called when the pick ray exits a scene object.</li>
 * <li>onInside(GVRSceneObject) called while the pick ray penetrates a scene object.</li>
 * <li>onPick(GVRPicker)        called when the set of picked objects changes.</li>
 * <li>onNoPick(GVRPicker)      called once when nothing is picked.</li>

     * {@code [dx, dy, dz]}. The ray is in the coordinate system of the
     * input transform, allowing it to be with respect to a scene object.
     *
     * <p>
     * The ray origin may be [0, 0, 0] and the direction components should be
     * normalized from -1 to 1: Note that the y direction runs from -1 at the
     * bottom to 1 at the top. To construct a picking ray originating at the
     * center of a scene object and pointing where that scene object looks,
     * attach the GVRPicker to the scene object and  pass (0, 0, 0) as
     * the ray origin and (0, 0, -1) for the direction.
     *
     * <p>
     * This method is thread safe because it guarantees that only
     * one thread at a time is doing a ray cast into a particular scene graph,
     * and it extracts the hit data during within its synchronized block. You
     * can then examine the return list without worrying about another thread
     * corrupting your hit data.
     * <p/>
     * Depending on the type of collider, that the hit location may not be exactly
     * where the ray would intersect the scene object itself. Rather, it is
     * where the ray intersects the collision geometry associated with the collider.
